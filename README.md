==========Description==========
This is a project to try and implement multiple quantum secure algorithms in a practical sense. To dod this we chose to implement the said
algorithms in a cryptocurrency. We believe that this is the best way to show multiple algorithms working together efficiently and demonstrate
their capabilities.
